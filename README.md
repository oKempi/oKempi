### Hello I'm oKempi
and I am learning Java ☕ and Python 🐍
<br>

<br>

- 📫You can find me on Discord under my name Kempi111 (although I usually do not accept requests 😅)
- 🤔 If you have suggestions for my repos just try to DM me on Discord or put an Issue and pray🙏 I get to see it
- I am currently working on a Mindustry mod called ERMod in Java ☕ (hopefully soon I will feel like the mod is good enough and release it to the public!)
